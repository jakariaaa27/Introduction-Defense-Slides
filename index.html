        <p>Accurate identification of Chinese herbs is crucial in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to ensure patient safety and effective treatment. However, existing research in Chinese herb recognition has been limited in terms of recognized herbal categories and the manual data collection process, hindering the development of a comprehensive and efficient recognition system. This study aims to address these limitations by proposing an automated Chinese herb recognition system. We have developed an automated Chinese herb recognition system that empowers users, regardless of their computer expertise, to easily recognize different types of herbs, add new herb categories, and train the system for accurate recognition. By leveraging AI techniques, the system preprocesses data, including cropping images, removing shadows, and augmenting datasets. We employed the DC-ShadowNet model for shadow removal and utilized RandAugment for data augmentation. Image classification was performed using the Swin Transformer model. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our system, with a combination of the Swin Transformer model and RandAugment achieving the highest accuracy of 99.1%. Surprisingly, the inclusion of shadow removal did not lead to improved results, indicating that shadows may contribute to the features essential for Chinese herb recognition. Our findings highlight the importance of considering surface characteristics and shadow presence in accurate herb classification. Through this research, we have developed an automated Chinese herb recognition system that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches. By integrating AI and automation, our system streamlines the Chinese herb identification process, making it accessible to users without extensive IT backgrounds. This advancement in recognition technology contributes to the broader application and understanding of Chinese herbs in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p>
