      <p>This research presents an innovative approach for simulating force plate measurements using smart insoles, a portable and practical tool that extends biomechanical analysis beyond laboratory settings. While traditional force plate measurements are insightful, their static nature and controlled environments limit their usefulness. Our solution leverages a Deep Regression Model, specifically the ResNet architecture, known for its effective representation of complex data relationships and ability to handle deeper networks. This study focuses particularly on standing data, which present unique challenges due to the limited variability compared to other activities such as walking, and wide range of individual variations. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and clustering techniques. DTW measures the similarity between two temporal sequences, accounting for varying speeds, making it apt for this study. Clustering of data from 21 participants based on DTW distances allows for customized modeling, accounting for individual variations and revealing subtle patterns within similar groups. Our methodology yielded a highly accurate model, demonstrated by an impressive R2 score of 0.996, indicating our model can explain 99.6% of the variability in the response data around its mean. This research paves the way for future exploration of other activities, such as running or jumping, extending the application and scope of mobile force plate simulations.</p>
